# extensions-send-to-translate

A Firefox extension that adds a context menu to translate selected text using Google translate.

The few extensions I found to do this either:

* Have a lot of extraneous, perhaps telemetry or tracking-related code.
* Did not update their translation URL slugs.

So this is for my own peace of mind.

## To Do

See `TODO.md`.
